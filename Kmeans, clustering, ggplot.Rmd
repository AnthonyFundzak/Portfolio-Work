#The business of sport and the teams within the sport is directly and most impacted directly by the perfromance of the team. Making trades, signings, cuts or any other roster move directly impacts the buisness of the team and can change millions of dollars in profits or losses for the team through ticket sales, merchandise, and other forms of revenue lines. Making roster decisions is something that goes on everyday within the teams front office so that is why I chose this side of business, the sport business world, as my final project. At the end of Major League Baseball seasons, front offices need to cluster and illustrate their players throughout the organization showing their performance and which players stood above the rest. This will help them identify how to make upcoming roster adjustments and anything else to do with the roster. For my case, I am specifically going to be looking at the 2021 Cleveland Guardians and players who recorded stats on the  main man roster. The goal of this is to illustrate visual explanations and summaries to better understand where each player compares to others that played on the active man roster throughout the season.

--For this specific project, I will be looking at only Position players, no pitchers.

# Finding a histogram of the batting averages can show a good representation of the distribution across the players in the data set. As you can sde from the following below histogram, the mean batting averages ranges between .200 and .250 which for MLB standards is low.This in tern lets the front office know they need to target more players than can hit on a higher consitent average. 
```[r]
> hist(BattingAverages)
![Histogram.](histogram BA.png)
```

#Finding a scatter plot through ggplot can show each player on a scale as to where they are compared with other playes in the data being tested. This scatter plot shows the front office whihc of their posistion players at the most hits compared to at bats, another way of looking at the batting average in the histogram. It gives the front office the business decision of what to do with the player as they can compare players to players and compare visualizations from year to year.
```[r]
>NoPitchers %>% ggplot(aes(x=H, y=AB, color= Name)) + geom_point()
![ScatterPlot.](Scatter BA.png)
```

#K-Means Clustering to show clusters of players. Showing clusters of players allows us to see where each player stands with eachother. The business decision that can be made off of this is knowing which players are similar to each other in each others games, leading the front office to make adjustments to the roster to get rid of the worse players in hope to imporve the teams future performance.
-- I remove these columns because they are values of NA/NaN/Inf which K-Means cannot handle.
```[r]
> NoPitchersKMeans<- NoPitchers[ -c(1,27) ]
> NoPitchersKMeans2 <- kmeans(NoPitchersKMeans, centers = 3, nstart=25)
```
I chose 3 centers becasue it was accompinied by 24 posisition players that made they active roster throughout the season. Fitting 3 clusters with 8 players comes to 33.33% in each cluster which is a great starting point to equally divide the players. 
```

```
his shows the main size of the clusters. By having 11 people in the first cluster and 9 in the middle cluster, this tells us the majority of the players where low caliber to middle tier with their batting and other offensive numbers. This aligns correctly with the 2021 Cleveland Guardians as the team had a poor record and had a near league low in offensive runs per game, again backed by the stats and data discovered above. The cluster of 4, the Guardians best players shows the front office who to invest in and build their team/business of the team around. 
```

```

Below, I am curious about the  umber of clusters to be used to put the 24 players into. So to expand on having 3 clusters, I decided to do clusters of 4,5, and 6.These visualiztions show that the clusters are narrow, longated and do not reflect the data as best as they can. As the clusters begin to increase on the way to 6 clusters, it becomes more evident that the players group further down into the poor offensive performance cluster rather than the prefered far right, better offensive stats group/cluster.

```[r]
> NoPitchersKMeans4 <- kmeans(NoPitchersKMeans, centers = 4, nstart=25)
> NoPitchersKMeans5 <- kmeans(NoPitchersKMeans, centers = 5, nstart=25)
> NoPitchersKMeans6 <- kmeans(NoPitchersKMeans, centers = 6, nstart=25)
> fviz_cluster(NoPitchersKMeans4, data = distance)
> fviz_cluster(NoPitchersKMeans5, data = distance)
> fviz_cluster(NoPitchersKMeans6, data = distance)

# Finding the optimal number of clusters using Average Silhoutette Method. This is the optimal method I believe because it determines how well each player/object lies within the clusters. The hihger the average the great indication of the best number of clusters. This method using different amounts of K (clusters) to determine the optimal fit. Showing in easy to read graphs is the main benefit since all stakeholders are able to understand these simple data visualizations.
```[r]
> library(cluster)
> avg_sil <- function(k) { km.res <- kmeans(NoPitchers, centers = k, nstart = 25)
+ ss <- silhouette(km.res$cluster, dist(NoPitchers))
+ mean(ss[, 3])}
> avg_sil_values <- map_dbl(k.values, avg_sil)
> plot(k.values, avg_sil_values,
+      type = "b", pch = 24, frame = FALSE, 
+      xlab = "Number of clusters K",
+      ylab = "Average Clusters")
![AVG_Cluster.](AVG_Sil.png)
>fviz_nbclust(NoPitchers, kmeans, method = "silhouette")
![FVIZ_Cluster.](Optimal_Clusters_Avg_Sil.png)
```
The result here of the optimal number clusters of 3, shown above, holds consistent with the findings of the original kmeans clustering. The number of 3 clusters comes with the highest average of silhouette width indicating that is the best fit number of clusters for the Indians posistion players who appeared on the active roster this season. Fviz_nbclust is a great use here because of its ability to draw a verticle line where the optimal number of clusters is. 

Once again, The business of sport and the teams within the sport is directly and most impacted directly by the perfromance of the team. Making trades, signings, cuts or any other roster move directly impacts the buisness of the team and can change millions of dollars in profits or losses for the team through ticket sales, merchandise, and other forms of revenue lines. Making roster decisions is something that goes on everyday within the teams front office so that is why I chose this side of business, the sport business world, as my final project. My findings above use the 2021 Cleveland Guardians active 25 man roster posistion players throughout the year to compare stats and cluster the players to help a front office make decisions on roster moves that will without a doubt have a business impact on the organization as a whole.
